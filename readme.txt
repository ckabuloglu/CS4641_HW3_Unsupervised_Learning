For this homework, I've written seperate python (python 2.7 and python 3) scripts for each dataset and certain algorithms

Running the scripts will produce the graphs I have acquired before since all of the use the same random state. 

To run the rest of the python scripts, the dependencies listed below needs to be 'pip install''ed and ran with the python command through terminal. 
Running the scripts will be simple reproduce the graphs which can be found in the figures folder.

Dependencies:
    - Matplotlib
    - Scipy
    - sklearn
    - numpy
    - seaborn
    - plot

These python files use python 3:
    - em.py
    - kmeans.py
    - cluster_nn.py

The rest of the python scripts are python 2.7

The data that I used to create the plots is found in the data folder.

The MATLAB script that plots the graphs can be found in the figures folder along with the graphs and plots
